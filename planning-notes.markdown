Fuel can only be hand delivered.

Food cached can be mailed or hand delivered to:

- White River Campground at White River, fuel
- Sunrise Visitor Center at Sunrise, fuel, late opener, close for the season shortly after Labor Day
- The Mowich Lake Patrol Cabin at Mowich Lake, fuel, late opener, closes mid September 


see trip planner - 6 days looks like good mileage(11 to 17 miles per day) but elevation changes may make an this too aggressive and difficult.
